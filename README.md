### Hi, I'm Mark! ðŸ‘‹
I'm a support technician from Edinburgh, Scotland. I work on fixing people's problems, and automating the processes in my workplace.

I work in a wide variety of technologies, with my strongest languages being Rust and Powershell. (But don't expect me to be good at English.)

Currently studying for:
- CompTIA Network+
- CompTIA Security+
- M365 Security Administrator Associate
